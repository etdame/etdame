# 👨‍💻 Experience

High-functioning architect of algorithmic curiosity with a demonstrated history of deploying predictive rituals and tabular sorcery to summon meaning from numerical chaos. Former lead of ephemeral pipeline stabilization at the Institute for Accidental Insights, where I pioneered asynchronous confusion in multi-cloud environments using only Python, determination, and a handful of forgotten SQL joins.

- Recursive error propagation (as a lifestyle choice)  
- Vectorized regret minimization  
- End-to-end confusion pipelines (with optional dashboards)  
- The exact moment your model "just vibes" instead of generalizing
- Dart-throwing mobile engineering (Flutter)  
- Interactive illusions with SvelteKit
